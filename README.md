# KomaruBotWeb

KomaruBot is a [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) chatbot designed for Super Metroid speedrunning streamers.

KomaruBot has a variety of features, including:
* Ceres Bot guessing - Viewers guess what in-game time you will finish Ceres station at, and receive points based on the actual time
* Loyalty Points gambling - Viewers can gamble their Loyalty Points and lose them all, or win big
* Hype Commands - "Spammy" commands can be configured at a cost of Loyalty Points. Output a 5-wide Illuminati Pyramid for 10,000 Loyalty Points!
* Use your own Chat Bot Account - Create your own Twitch Account to use as your Bot Account. KomaruBot will send the same messages in chat, but through your unique account!
* Customizable Everything - Want your points to be called "Botwoon Bucks"? You got it! Don't want any gambling? Turn it off! Want to adjust how Ceres winners win points? No problem!

Even more features are in the works:
* Split Guessing - Have viewers guess what time you'll get on a particular split, for Loyalty Points
* LiveSplit Plugin - Have the Split Guessing results happen automatically when you split!
* Baby Metroid Minigame - Viewers will be able to progress through Super Metroid, collecting upgrades. They'll interact with the Baby Metroid, feeding it enemies such as Torizo and Space Pirates. Collect enough items and take on the Super Metroid Bosses!
